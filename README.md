## About the data
The Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use File (Inpatient PUF) provides information on inpatient discharges for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The Inpatient PUF includes information on utilization, payment (total payment and Medicare payment), and hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments. The PUF is organized by hospital and Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) and covers Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 through FY 2018.However, these files do not include information on the level of rurality about the communities where those hospitals are located.
